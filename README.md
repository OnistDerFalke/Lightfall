# Lightfall

## Overview
Platform PC game with manual or automatic level creation. Player is an astronaut that has lost his rocketship and landed on dark planet. His lightsource is a helmet that uses much power so the player has to collect batteries to make the light working again. The main aim of the game is to look for the RGB sunspheres to destroy the darkness on the planet.
There are enemies nearby, moving blocks and unknown jumps. Moreover the light is getting darker and darker until we find battery again. You need to be fast - battery number is finite.

Level 1 is manually created level with two directional movement with full experience. Level 2 is endless rush with one way automatic movement - something like classic flappy bird but more platformer.

**Enjoy!**
